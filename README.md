# Pokémon Red and Blue: Social Distancing Edition

A Romhack of Pokémon Red/Blue where trainers respect social distancing guidelines. 

Trainers will leave an empty space between themselves & the player before starting a battle. You can also talk to NPCs from an additional tile away.

## Caveat

This is mostly meant as a joke: this might make the game unbeatable? (Let me know, and we can probably move trainers or obstacles around to fix it)
